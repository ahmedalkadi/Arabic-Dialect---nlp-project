### Arabic Dialect Classifier
#### Project Overview
This project aims to build a model for identifying and classifying different Arabic dialects from text data. The classification ranges from using traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Logistic Regression (LR) and Decision Trees, to more complex deep learning (DL) approaches like Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and hybrid models combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with LSTMs, to improve accuracy in dialect classification.

#### Objectives
Develop and compare various ML and DL models for classifying Arabic dialects.
Improve the accuracy of dialect classification through advanced techniques.
Provide a comprehensive framework for Arabic dialect classification that can be extended and refined.
#### Tools and Technologies
TensorFlow: For building and training deep learning models.
Scikit-learn: For implementing traditional machine learning algorithms and performing data preprocessing.
